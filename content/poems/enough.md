* *Enough*
* {{< poem-space >}}
* Cowbells in the distance
* Dissonance afar.
* Possibility and yearning
* Under a sky full of stars.
* Somewhere the mountains call 
* For a fleet-footed boy 
* To cross them all.
* Another day, he said, with bright reassurance
* But little did he know 
* There would be no other occurrence.
* Later is a long time to wait 
* and life took its swing
* Along with life he went and gone were his dreams.
* Kept hidden and out of sight
* He lost them all in a single night.
* They returned to the stars above
* Waiting for another day
* For someone new to look up and say
* This is enough.
