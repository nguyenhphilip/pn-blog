{{< poem_open >}}

* Two birds in unison along a grayed shore walking
* and squawking like inseparable twins
* {{< poem-space >}}
* Talking and squealing in that terrifying tongue 
* only they can understand,
* {{< poem-space >}}
* Mocking our efforts to tame the unknown, laughing 
* because we canâ€™t in the face of uncertainty.
* {{< poem-space >}}
* But for all our differences, I was reassured to find 
* that they shit
* {{< poem-space >}}
* In much the same way
* we do.
