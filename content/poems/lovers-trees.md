* *Lovers*
* {{< poem-space >}}
* Winter stripped you of your Colors
* and left you standing – Naked –
* without so much as a kiss
* <br>
* while the two lovers climbed your branches
* and celebrated together
* all that they would miss.
* <br>
* They declared their Love
* with their crooked names
* on your soft bark–
* <br>
* "For you," they whispered,
* as you smiled above, no longer lonely
* in the afternoon dark.
