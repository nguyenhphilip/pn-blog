* *Knowledge*
* {{< poem-space >}}
* She sits in her lab
* with a handful of instruments
* and a head full of clues.
* Surrounding her are guesses,
* and things she already knew.
* If only she could see it,
* if only she could understand
* how it all fits together
* in the grand master plan.
* The past always resolves the future,
* so she's learned, 
* in the present of her time,
* but still, she feels,
* There is so much left to find,
* there is still so much to know.
