* She sits in her lab
* with a handful of instruments
* and a head full of clues.
* Surrounding her are guesses,
* and things She already knew.
* If only She could see it,
* if only She could understand
* how it all fits together
* in the grand master plan.
* The past always resolves the future,
* or so she's told, 
* in the present of her time,
* but still, She feels,
* There is so much left to find,
* there is still so much to know.
