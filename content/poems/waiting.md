* *Waiting*
* {{< poem-space >}}
* The news came over you
* the way winter
* {{< poem-space >}}
* does, like a wave crawling
* up your spine,
* {{< poem-space >}}
* every goosebump a sign
* that the story
* {{< poem-space >}}
* you lived by would soon
* come to its
* {{< poem-space >}}
* end. The fire warming 
* your heart makes 
* {{< poem-space >}}
* way for the embers 
* and ashes, 
* {{< poem-space >}}
* for all that’s left, black 
* scars and burn 
* {{< poem-space >}}
* marks, a house without 
* a roof, memories 
* {{< poem-space >}}
* forever frozen 
* in place. You’ll
* {{< poem-space >}}
* Know he’s gone when
* the silence
* {{< poem-space >}}
* settles like
* dust.
