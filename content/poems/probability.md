* *Probability*
* {{< poem-space >}}
* Hello Chance–
* haven't you had enough?
* Just grant me this once
* a single wish from above.
* I'm asking for Reassurance, perhaps–
* and maybe
* Possibility too.
* Certainly
* certainties will do–
* But if that's too much to ask for
* just leave me flowers at my door
* so I may count my blessings
* on petals once more.
