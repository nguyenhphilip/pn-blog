{{< poem_open >}}

* I took a walk to a great green park
* Where stones lie dormant, and giants praise the sky.
* There I saw your mother, and she asked me,
* What have you witnessed today?
* Was it the color of my children or the echoes of the winged?
* Was it another one of your kind, discovering for the first time
* the sweet nectar of solitude?
* Was it the land giving everything away, asking
* for nothing in return?
* {{< poem-space >}}
* I came seeking meaning but left with so much more.
* She brought me to you, to the grass and the sun,
* To the roots I daily stand upon.
* The flowers sprang forth with their inviting arms
* and asked me, their newcomer, to stay while.
* {{< poem-space >}}
* Listen, they whispered.
* Thereâ€™s something you need to hear.
