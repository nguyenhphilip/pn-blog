* The only way this works
* is if we catch each other.
* We’re experienced, yes, but the connection 
* is never guaranteed, even after all these years. 
* The nets below don’t carry 
* the weight of our selfish love,
* nor does the crowd. 
* They wonder how we do what we do,
* why we take the risks we take, 
* but we’re just doing our job, 
* putting on a performance 
* for an audience of one. 
* Sometimes we fall 
* but that’s a part of the deal –
* We’re acrobats of the dark she said,
* two loose cannons 
* shooting for the stars,
* two trapeze artists vaulting 
* over loneliness,
* two unhinged orbits 
* destined to collide.
