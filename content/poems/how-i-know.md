* *How I Know*
* {{< poem-space >}}
* A moment of connection
* A brief glimmer of affection
* {{< poem-space >}}
* Grass grazing underfoot
* Deep feelings understood
* {{< poem-space >}}
* Where the wave meets the shoreline
* Where space and time intertwine
* {{< poem-space >}}
* A mind truly touched
* A heart fully loved
* {{< poem-space >}}
* That's how I know
* It’s where I’ll go
* {{< poem-space >}}
* That's how I know
* It's where I need to be
