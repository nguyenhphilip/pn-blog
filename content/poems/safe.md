* The path always leads back to you,
* my dear,
* To here where the earth meets the sky
* to kiss the lips of the horizon,
* To here where leaf towers and wildflowers rise
* to drink and revel in the morning sun,
* To here where the sea softens its siren calls
* for whispers of solitude,
* To here where sorrows
* are given light,
* To here where shadows
* go to die,
* To here, my dear,
* a place just beyond myself
* where all voices were meant
* to sing.
