* older
* and still no closer
* to heaven. But please,
* leave me–
* {{< poem-space >}}
* Leave me here where
* my prayers are answered
* in the rhyme of a Dickinson
* or the riff of a Sultana–
* {{< poem-space >}}
* Leave me here on the breast
* of the earth where angels
* kiss sinners like me
* over tea and late night memories
* on Sunday mornings–
* {{< poem-space >}}
* Leave me here where the blessing
* of caressing hands is enough
* to bend a celibate to his knees
* over the pulpit of her body
* as they mouth Hallelujah–
* {{< poem-space >}}
* Leave me here alone
* in the bedroom of midnight
* so I may wake drenched
* in the sweat of stars
* and surrendered dreams–
* {{< poem-space >}}
* Leave me here where salvation
* can be found on a coastline
* under hails of light bursting
* through the winged cathedral
* of a redwood canopy–
* {{< poem-space >}}
* Leave me here where the mind
* is wider than the sky
* and contains so much
* more
* than I–
* {{< poem-space >}}
* Leave me here
* and heaven forbid
* the day I arrive
* at the holy promenade
* without my return ticket–
* {{< poem-space >}}
* Leave me here
* to dwell in possibility–
* {{< poem-space >}}
* –in the only promise
* guaranteed.
