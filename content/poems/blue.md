* I walked to the lake
* &emsp; to skip
* &emsp;&emsp; stones
* &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; the way people do
* {{< poem-space >}}
* with their thoughts
* &emsp; when they at last notice
* &emsp;&emsp; that their pockets
* &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; are full.
* {{< poem-space >}}
* Then you honked at me
* &emsp; in your hurried voice
* &emsp;&emsp; Good morning - Good morning!
* &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; and invited me to linger
* {{< poem-space >}}
* as your webbed feet waltzed
* &emsp; toe by toe
* &emsp;&emsp; across the sand
* &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; into the wild open blue
* {{< poem-space >}}
