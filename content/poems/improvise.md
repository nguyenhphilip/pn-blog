* I am a living shadow of the life I dream–
* The Golden days are so far it seems–
* One step forward and two skips back–
* Time is ticking away–tick–tick–clack–
* I’m supposed to have This figured out–
* But still I don’t know what this Play is all About?–
* Read the script now the Mind pouts–
* No–write more Reason shouts–
* The curtain will soon fall–
* Already on stage–it's last call!–
* Hide your face and be disguised–
* Show the emotions we improvised–
* Outside–applause in the dark unseen–
* Inside–thoughts clouding the movie screen–
