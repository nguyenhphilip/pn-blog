* There I threw my sorrows
* In hopes that they would stay.
* Instead you returned tomorrow
* with the weight of yesterday.
* <br>
* Forgive me for asking twice,
* I've already begged in prayer–
* He gave me back a palm full of ice,
* a reminder that life wasn't fair.
* <br>
* The crows made their sighs
* and the sunflowers bowed–
* I screamed shouted and cried
* while you stood indifferent and proud.
* <br>
* The grass gleamed with dew
* as I endured the pain–
* But the earth smiled, renewed,
* and thanked me for the rain.
