* *To the Sky*
* {{< poem-space >}}
* There I threw my sorrows
* in hopes that they would stay.
* Instead you returned tomorrow
* with the weight of yesterday.
* {{< poem-space >}}
* Forgive me for asking twice,
* I've already begged in prayerâ€“
* He gave me a palm filled with ice,
* a reminder that life wasn't fair.
* {{< poem-space >}}
* The crows made their sighs
* and the sunflowers bowed,
* I screamed shouted and cried
* while you stood indifferent and proud.
* {{< poem-space >}}
* The grass gleamed with dew
* as I endured the cold pain,
* but the earth smiled, renewed,
* and thanked me for the rain.
