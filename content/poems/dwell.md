* What rooms of the soul
* have we left unchecked
* Forgotten and locked away
* With the key nowhere to be found?
* Don't worry. 
* The door is still open.
* Climb the creaking stairs
* Open the dust-covered drawers and look in
* Run your fingers along the wooden shelves 
* now draped in darkness,
* somewhere in the attic of your mind.
* Once there you may rediscover
* the very thing 
* You have been searching for
* Your entire life.
* Prepare yourself: 
* The ghosts will cry and beckon.
* But don't run.
* Sit and stay awhile.
* Get to know yourself.
* Offer light
* and accept the forgiveness
* that soon follows.
