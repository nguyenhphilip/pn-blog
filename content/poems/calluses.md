* The things they’ve seen–
* The places they’ve been–
* The hands and
* Oh! the people they’ve touched
* {{< poem-space >}}
* let go and let in.
* {{< poem-space >}}
* Mountains of accumulating scars–
* Memories of forgotten days counting stars–
* Mistakes years in the making
* forever etched
* {{< poem-space >}}
* in the pulp of my naked hands.
* {{< poem-space >}}
* Now forming at my fingertips–
* Now tracing the plum of new lips–
* Now paving mazes of foreign roads
* toward the cliff of some unknown future,
* {{< poem-space >}}
* mine.
* {{< poem-space >}}
* Catch me still searching for meaning in grains–
* Catch me still chasing horizons for nothing–
* Catch me still losing myself
* in words and in love
* {{< poem-space >}}
* over
* {{< poem-space >}}
* and over
* again–

{{< poem_close >}}
