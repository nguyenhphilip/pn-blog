* *Exhalation*
* {{< poem-space >}}
* Before there was you
* Before there was you and your billowing laugh
* Your callused hands and crooked smile 
* waiting for me at the end of the night
* like temptation drunk on cherry wine
* {{< poem-space >}}
* Before there was the oak that introduced us
* Before there were the stars we claimed as ours
* Before love and wonder were forces we would never tame
* Before time had entered the fray
* Before there was the story of everything, waiting to unfold,
* Nothing was the only thing
* And that was enough for a universe.
