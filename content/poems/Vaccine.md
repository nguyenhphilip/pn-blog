* Vaccine
* {{< poem-space >}}
* There’s a quiet hope
* behind your tired eyes.
* You ask for my history,
* press my unsure utterances
* into the worn keys,
* and inform me of the procedure.
* I ask for your story
* and we make small talk,
* hoping the moment will last–
* it’s the best kind of talk
* we get nowadays.
* You touch my shoulder
* and recommend a movie,
* after I finish pretending
* to know something about life.
* Life is something to give,
* your eyes reassure.
* I try my best
* to savor every fleeting second.
* And then just like that
* you’re gone,
* you a bee who knows
* when a wildflower has bloomed.
