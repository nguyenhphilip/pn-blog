* *A Prayer*
* {{< poem-space >}}
* I.
* {{< poem-space >}}
* In the riptide
* &emsp; &emsp; of 
* &emsp; &emsp; this moment
* may I act out of &emsp;	goodwill,
* may I rediscover
* the goodness &emsp; of others
* &emsp; &emsp; made obfuscate
* by timelines &emsp; &emsp; and party lines
* &emsp; &emsp; and tighten the loosened thread
* that ties us all
* &emsp; together.
* {{< poem-space >}}
* II.
* {{< poem-space >}}
* The gift is knowing
* what ails you
* {{< poem-space >}}
* the privilege is holding &emsp; &emsp;	that truth
* without turning &emsp; away–
* {{< poem-space >}}
* what I fear most is not that you will hurt me
* because in many ways you already have
* but that I may never understand	&emsp; why
* {{< poem-space >}}
* III. 
* {{< poem-space >}}
* &emsp; &emsp; What I fear
* most is not that &emsp;	my side is losing
* but that we
* &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; are lost.
* {{<poem-space >}}
* IV. 
* {{< poem-space >}}
* May I summon &emsp;	the courage to speak
* &emsp; &emsp; not out of &emsp; hate &emsp; or righteousness
not out of the pain	&emsp; I’ve held for so long
* both for myself &emsp;	and for others,
* {{< poem-space >}}
* but from the soft palpitations of a heart
* &emsp; &emsp; in search of redemption,
* &emsp; from the voice of a nation 
* &emsp; &emsp; dying for reconciliation.
* {{< poem-space >}}
* V. 
* {{< poem-space >}}
* May our differences
* sharpen our similarities.
* {{< poem-space >}}
* May I be bold enough
* to witness your suffering
* {{< poem-space >}}
* and subsequently illuminate 
* the shape of my own.
* {{< poem-space >}}
* May we surf the edges with evermore grace
* so that we can rise above the inevitable tide,
* {{< poem-space >}}
* swim ashore and dance 
* to the drumming of a fragile anthem
* {{< poem-space >}}
* celebrating
* the birth of a nation.
