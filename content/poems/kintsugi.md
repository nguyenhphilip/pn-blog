_The Japanese art of repairing broken pottery._

* **_I. Summer of COVID-19_**
* {{< poem-space >}}
* This time around
* the antagonist is a consequence
* {{< poem-space >}}
* of randomness
* and stupidity;
* {{< poem-space >}}
* Not the usual trail of mosquito bites
* lining my ankles after a night by the lake–
* {{< poem-space >}}
* Not the flakey crust of sunburned shoulders
* and sun-spoiled cider roiling in the drunk sand–
* {{< poem-space >}}
* Not the hurried kiss of a summer love
* meant to be a memory–
* {{< poem-space >}}
* No instead I am accompanied by an unfounded certainty,
* a future I cannot yet begin to imagine
* {{< poem-space >}}
* without compromising the numerous stitches
* already upholding the architecture
* {{< poem-space >}}
* of a life once mine.
* {{< poem-space >}}

* **_II. In the Dark_**
* {{< poem-space >}}
* Oscillating between
* {{< poem-space >}}
* despair and 
* restlessness; 
* {{< poem-space >}}
* newsfeeds 
* and skin–
* {{< poem-space >}}
* poems and
* music;
* {{< poem-space >}}
* pasts and
* a reality
* {{< poem-space >}}
* running from reach.
* {{< poem-space >}}
* {{< poem-space >}}
* **_III. Falling_**
* {{< poem-space >}}
* Your face in the bathroom mirror 
* again staring back at someone
* something unknowable 
* wondering how long
* it takes for regret 
* to leave 
* the 
* body
* {{< poem-space >}}
* {{< poem-space >}}
* **_IV. How_**
* {{< poem-space >}}
* To move forward?
* {{< poem-space >}}
* To get over myself?
* {{< poem-space >}}
* To save myself
* {{< poem-space >}}
* when I myself
* {{< poem-space >}}
* lack myself
* {{< poem-space >}}
* the smiling 
* {{< poem-space >}}
* confidence
* {{< poem-space >}}
* of an untouched life?
* {{< poem-space >}}
* {{< poem-space >}}
* **_V. Kintsugi_**
* {{< poem-space >}}
* Begin with love
* and generous fingertips,
* yours. Lace the roiled sand
* between the cracks
* and piece together
* the moments
* one by one.
* Hold them still
* as if your life
* depended on 
* it–it does–
* and wait.
* Growth requires
* time. Meaning 
* demands patience.
