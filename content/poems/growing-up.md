* Hunched over in your garden
* like a daylily on the boardwalk watching
* the world spin faster
* and faster on its slant axis,
* you still water the plants we bought for you
* three summers ago, as if
* you were still showering us
* with your wordless love,
* with your thankless devotion,
* praying one day that
* we will eventually grow
* back in your direction.
