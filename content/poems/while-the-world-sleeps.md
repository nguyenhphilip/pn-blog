* *while the world sleeps*
* {{< poem-space >}}
* While the world sleeps
* I wake
* into the soft unfolding
* of morning.
* {{< poem-space >}}
* Between pages I’ve suddenly
* forgotten (forgive me Syzmborska)
* is clasped
* a single thread
* {{< poem-space >}}
* of auburn.
* It’s been four weeks since
* I last found you
* rising
* {{< poem-space >}}
* and falling
* like a fawn yet nuzzled
* by the cold breath
* of winter
* {{< poem-space >}}
* and demands
* beside me
* beneath familiar sheets.
* My poems miss
* {{< poem-space >}}
* your eyes,
* my fingers
* your scars,
* my world
* {{< poem-space >}}
* your presence.
* While the world sleeps
* I wake
* into the color
* {{< poem-space >}}
* of your absense.
* {{< poem-space >}}
