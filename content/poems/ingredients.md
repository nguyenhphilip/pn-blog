* *ingredients*
* {{< poem-space >}}
* One pinch of fun, well enough for two.
* Two cups of trust â€“ three for the adventurous.
* Four cloves of love, and more for good measure.
* Five pounds of respect to ensure a firm foundation.
* Six licks to taste, just in case things turn sour.
* Eight hints of promises, so seven can be broken
* and forgiven. Nine gallons of luck, Papa said,
* because life always get messy.
* Ten drops of honey, to top things off.
