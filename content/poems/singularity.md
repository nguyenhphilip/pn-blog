{{< poem_open >}}

* We were in this together
* Once–Inseparable
* like time and gravity,
* {{< poem-space >}}
* Our love
* {{< poem-space >}}
* A singularity
* That even the Big Bang
* Grew jealous of.
* {{< poem-space >}}
* Was it inevitable then
* That we would drift
* {{< poem-space >}}
* Apart? You
* {{< poem-space >}}
* At the speed of light,
* {{< poem-space >}}
* I
* {{< poem-space >}}
* The cold crawl
* Of Pluto.
* {{< poem-space >}}
* My hope rests
* In cosmic equations,
* Promises
* {{< poem-space >}}
* Written on the sky.
* {{< poem-space >}}
* It’s out of the question:
* I know we’ll be together
* Once the show is over
* {{< poem-space >}}
* And begins again.
* {{< poem-space >}}
* But until then
* There is only
* {{< poem-space >}}
* This
* {{< poem-space >}}
* And less
* On the trail of your blazing star.
