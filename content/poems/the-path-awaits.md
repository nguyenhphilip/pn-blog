* The path awaits
* all who come
* with enough courage
* to walk among
* the tall shadows
* in search of 
* something beyond
* the stories harbored
* by our lonely selves
* the result of which
* was nothing of your doing
* but yours to carry anyways.
* The unfairness of it all
* nearly crushes you
* your heart hardens
* but you fall and rise
* as the beckoning
* of something greater
* calls to you
* and offers 
* your soul
* a morsel 
* of light.
