* The path awaits
* all who come
* with enough courage
* to walk among
* the tall shadows
* in search of 
* something beyond
* the stories harbored
* by our lonely selves,
* the result of which
* was nothing of your doing
* but yours to carry anyways
* like a scar engraved
* on the contours of your heart.
* The unfairness of it all
* nearly crushes you
* and you fall but rise
* as the beckoning
* of something greater
* calls to you
* and offers 
* your soul
* a morsel 
* of light.
* You heed the call
* and begin
* the slow crawl
* that slowly becomes
* a steady walk,
* then a sprint
* toward unknown
* horizons.
