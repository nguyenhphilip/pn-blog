* the child inside me yearns
* for something more–
* a clue, perhaps, a sign,
* another open door–
* {{< poem-space >}}
* the white walls surrounding me
* are falling like wavering petals–
* the world says keep them up,
* Why can't you just Settle?
* {{< poem-space >}}
* My restless mind looks through
* the windowsill and begs
* for the world outside–
* Go, now, it whispers,
* there is nothing here
* left to hide.
* {{< poem-space >}}
* Be bold. Be brave.
* Put on a straight face
* and take the leap –
* what opportunities missed
* when fear runs deep.
