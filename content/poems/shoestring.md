* She’s everything but endearing.
* Yet she grabs you 
* like a shoestring
* And twirls you around 
* Her wirey fingertips the way 
* a red-faced child does 
* with their spaghetti.
* {{< poem-space >}}
* You can’t help but notice 
* the look in her eyes.
* She’s transfixed, yes,
* Escape is no longer possible.
* {{< poem-space >}}
* You sigh and think to yourself 
* The only way this can end 
* Is in ruin and tragedy. You’re either 
* Heartbroken by your fears
* Or brokenhearted for doing nothing at all
* While she sits and tears you apart
* From the little loops that once grounded
* Your average life.
* {{< poem-space >}}
* Still you make the leap.
* You spill your heart out 
* and hope that she doesn’t 
* drop it.
* {{< poem-space >}}
* She catches it
* Though her nails are sharp and
* Unlike any that have had the privilege
* Of holding your touchy soul.
* {{< poem-space >}}
* You’re scared of getting hurt
* You’re scared of falling in love
* But you tell yourself
* Yes, it’s worth it
* Yes, it’s worth the trouble.
* {{< poem-space >}}
* Or perhaps someone has lied to you
* But no one has to know.
* What happens between two people
* Is a story left for their hands alone.
