* Pens and paintbrushes
* scattered on the bathroom floor.
* Half-finished poems
* and crooked photos
* line the chipping walls.
* In the dark corners our two desks rest–
* the candles are beyond extinguished–
* our eyesight isn't the best.
* Loved ones tell us they're concerned
* they say we need something different
* But we can still see
* we already have
* All that we dream of.
