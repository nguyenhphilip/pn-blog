* *Our Room*
* {{< poem-space >}}
* Pens and paintbrushes
* scattered on the bathroom floor.
* Half-finished poems
* and crooked photos
* line the chipping walls.
* In the dark corners our two desks rest.
* The candles are beyond extinguished,
* our eyesight isn't the best.
* Loved ones tell us they're concerned,
* they say we need something different,
* but we can still see
* that we already have
* All we can dream of
* and more.
