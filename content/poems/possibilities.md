* *Possibilities*
* {{< poem-space >}}
* I prefer chocolate.
* I prefer music.
* I prefer facts dancing with feelings.
* I prefer Dandelion to Cherry Wine.
* I prefer trees dressed in autumn.
* I prefer keeping a notebook and pen on hand, just in case.
* I prefer the quiet of silence
* to the silence of absence.
* I prefer the color green.
* I prefer rebels.
* I prefer not to maintain
* that convenience is always convenient.
* I prefer to wake early.
* I prefer to sleep late when it’s wrong.
* I prefer talking to therapists about something else.
* I prefer used books.
* I prefer the absurdity of kids
* to the absurdity of adults.
* I prefer, where love’s concerned, nonspecific anniversaries
* that can be celebrated every moment.
* I prefer friends
* who promise me nothing.
* I prefer bittersweet compassion to everyday kindness.
* I prefer surprises.
* I prefer the earth in hand-me-downs.
* I prefer bordering countries to bordered ones.
* I prefer the hell of questions to the hell of answers.
* I prefer cats.
* I prefer dogs unleashed.
* I prefer the creased line of a Szymborska
* to the headline of a newspaper.
* I prefer the thrill of knowing to the thrill of believing.
* I prefer light eyes, since mine are dark.
* I prefer laughter.
* I prefer joy to happiness.
* I prefer things I’ve forgotten to say
* to things I’ve left unsaid.
* I prefer the time of seasons to the time of stars.
* I prefer to have faith.
* I prefer ideas to movements.
* I prefer keeping in mind even the possibility
* that existence has its own raison d'être.
