* Snow and frost for people and sidewalks.
* Inches and burdens
* for sauntered footfalls.
* {{< poem-space >}}
* There is a season between seasons,
* a bridge crossed by the plentiful few.
* Adults and scientists seek it endlessly,
* though only the children know
* of its whereabouts.
* But don’t bother with asking them –– 
* they’re sworn to the promises of secrecy.
* {{< poem-space >}}
* I make no guarantees of my own.
* Certainty is certainly
* out of the picture.
* Though some day you may catch wind of
* what it is and
* where it may be found.
* {{< poem-space >}}
* A clue:
* It may be right in front of you.
* Between one breath of Winter and
* one sigh of Spring
* exists everything essential.
