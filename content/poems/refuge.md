* Find refuge in my Harbor
* the water Here is clear,
* Your Storm is now over
* Rest easy now, my Dear.
* <br>
* Let your Anchor reach
* the depths of my Sea,
* Let it Sink with Time
* while you set yourself Free.
* <br>
* Strip the worn Sails
* and cast them to new Hands,
* Let them–Taste–again
* the Salt of warm Sands.
* <br>
* Turn the Whites into Doves
* that soar the open sky,
* Turn the Kites into Loves
* who Fly you through Night.
