A California native turned New England leaf peeper, I currently work on the [ABCD Study](https://abcdstudy.org) in Vermont, the largest longitudinal study of adolescent brain development in the US. I'm also a graduate student in the [Complex Systems and Data Science](https://vermontcomplexsystems.org/) program at the University of Vermont.

I [walked across Spain](/tags/camino-de-santiago) once and [wrote about it](/tags/camino-de-santiago).

Books, [poems](/poems/), people, playing outside, and learning bring me joy.
