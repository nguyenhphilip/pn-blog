A California native turned New England leaf peeper, I currently help run the [ABCD Study](https://abcdstudy.org) in Vermont, the largest longitudinal study of adolescent brain development in the US. In the Fall of 2020, I will be studying [Complex Systems and Data Science](https://vermontcomplexsystems.org/) at University of Vermont.

I [walked across Spain](/tags/camino-de-santiago) once and [wrote about it](/tags/camino-de-santiago).

Books, [poems](/poems/), people, playing outside, and learning bring me joy.
