I started the week in partial limbo. This usually happens when I lack a sense of direction and things to do. But the week went on and my mood improved when I committed myself to learning mathematics. What prompted this was reading [Mathematics for the adventurous self-learner](https://www.neilwithdata.com/mathematics-self-learner). I also want to feel better prepared for graduate school, so it seemed like a logical project to take on.

I'm starting with Coursera's single variable calculus course taught by Professor Robert Ghrist, which has turned out to be the perfect follow-up to the SV Calculus sequence I've already taken at UVM. The course begins in a non-traditional way, starting with Taylor Series. So far I'm enjoying this approach. The material is not so basic that it bores me, but it is also challenging enough to warrant focus and effort.

### Other things that I'm enjoying:

I started reading [The Three Body Problem](https://www.amazon.com/Three-Body-Problem-Remembrance-Earths-Past-ebook/dp/B00IQO403K). It's good. Great actually. I'm enjoying the cultural and scientific questions that get raised in my mind as I progress through the story. A background in physics might deepen my appreciation for the ideas woven throughout the book, but the philosophical nature of the dilemmas faced by the characters has been more than enough to keep me engaged.

[The Art of the Metaphor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0edKgL9EgM). I came onto the poet Jane Hirshfield after reading ["The Weighing" on Brainpickings](https://www.brainpickings.org/2019/10/23/the-weighing-jane-hirshfield/). It brings to mind someone sitting quietly in a small naturally lit room, alone though not lonely, contemplating the nature of existence while looking at the trees living just outside her window. I read a bit more about Jane and discovered that she had studied Buddhism at the San Francisco Zen Center for 8 years. It made me realize that poetry is an extension of the joyful art of paying attention. This video is a short exploration of the metaphor, narrated by Jane and animated by Ben Pearce.

The joys and challenges of a budding relationship. Understanding expectation vs. reality. More on this later once I think about it more deeply.
