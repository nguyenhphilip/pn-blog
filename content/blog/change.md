Change, by definition, is uncomfortable. It asks you to work against the quicksand of comfort, it forces you to relinquish the wornout marks you still wear, it beckons you to surrender to the tumultuous winds of the unknown.

The hardest part isn’t starting. The hardest part is staying committed to the wild rhythms. It’s deciding to accept who you are and where you fall short, and taking continual action.

You don’t need to be a neuroscientist to know it's possible. Behold the world before you.
