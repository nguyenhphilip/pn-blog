Change, by definition, is uncomfortable. It asks us to work against the quicksand of comfort, it forces us to relinquish the wornout marks we still wear, it beckons us to surrender to the tumultuous winds of the unknown.

The hardest part isn’t starting. The hardest part is staying committed to the wild rhythms. It’s deciding to accept who we are and where we fall short, and taking continual action.

You don’t need to be a neuroscientist to know change is possible. But it sure helps, at least it does for me.
