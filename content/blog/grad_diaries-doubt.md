This was a rough week for me. I spent over 25 hours on a single assignment for one of my classes, Data Science II. Most of the problems included deriving probability distributions and some of their properties, which meant that I had to dust the cobwebs off of the many mathematical tools necessary to do so. And boy were they dusty.

I struggled, and I wasn’t sure how to gauge whether my struggles simply indicated a lack of mathematical fluency, which could be remedied through practice and a firmer grasp of the fundamentals, or if I just wasn’t “getting” it at some deeper intuitive level. This of course led me to wonder if I would _ever_ get it, to the degree that my professor or any other data science practitioner in the ivory tower or industry does. 

I was talking with my classmate Julia about this. Neither of us have academic backgrounds in math (she in linguistics, I in psychology), so we feel somewhat lost when it comes to the technical details. We lean on analogy and intuition more than anything, but sometimes it doesn’t feel like it’s enough. Sometimes one really does need to understand something deeply in order to grasp it intuitively. I don’t think anyone doubts that, but how hard should one try to get to this point? And what should one do if that point is never reached? Should we accept that we will never be as good as some of these other folks, or will stubbornness and persistence be our savior? Is it enough to be good enough? I think it is to Julia. She, perhaps rightly so, believes that there are probably at least a few organizations or groups of people in the world who would be happy to receive help from any average data scientist – not everyone needs a theory-stoned academic to solve their problems. They just want their problems solved.

So maybe what matters is being useful. Wherever we fall on the grand distribution of things, we can always serve those around us. That’s reassuring. But there are an infinite number of ways to be useful! Some of those ways are better suited for us than others, depending on things like personality, interests, and values. These are not moot considerations to ignore when reflecting on what is worth doing with your time. Anything worth doing in the long run involves expected challenges, but when it deprecates to a form of chronic struggle, to the point where you’re sleepwalking through life, you have to ask yourself why you’re pursuing that thing in the first place, and if you truly enjoy it. 

Is enjoyment really that important in a career? If The Why is the mission, then enjoyment is what defines our experience of it. It’s usually implied that, given we had the choice, we do enjoy what we work on, at least partially. But what we think we enjoy and even what we do enjoy can get distorted by the allure of prestige. Paired with ambition and you have yourself a deadly cocktail. It matters to see through this illusion, not just because [to do something well you have to enjoy it](http://www.paulgraham.com/love.html), but also because your work defines so much of your life, and hence the quality of it. This doesn’t mean that you’re supposed to be head-over-heels at every waking hour when working, because there are just some things you have to persist through. And some days just suck, for no reason. But would you be doing what you're doing if you were given the freedom and security to do whatever you wanted to do? If you could get at The Why in some other, more enjoyable way that caters to you as a person, why aren’t you doing that instead?

The other day I watched a video titled [“Why I’m Not a Scientist" by Youtuber 2Veritasium](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZtmX1nPmoA&list=LL&index=30). In it he shares his story about why he pursued something more artistic rather than academic. In addition to his background in biology, chemistry, and physics, he had been interested in many other things like music, acting, and making videos with his friends. The latter suited his personality more, and he also realized that he liked the idea of being a successful scientist more than the actual process of doing science. That realization was what led him to pursue a Ph.D. in Physics Education rather than one in Physics. Now he’s a Youtuber.

Sometimes I look at my bookshelf and see a different me. It’s full of poetry and short story collections, novels, and psychology books: The Body Keeps the Score. The Art of Seeing Things. How to Change Your Mind. Transcend. In the Realm of Hungry Ghosts. The Fear of Doing Nothing. The Denial of Death. Already Free. These books feel self-defining and like old friends I could chat with all day. There’s some technical science and math stuff in there too, but maybe that’s because I like knowing about the world more than being the guy who generates its knowledge, scientifically speaking. I also think a lot about the conversations I have with my closest friends, who at times often know me better than myself. Words like healer, writer, artist, psychologist are thrown at me in both nonchalant and serious tones, even from my Dad. I’ve helped many of them with personal issues and naturally gravitate toward a helper role in these conversations. Rather than study stories, which is what I’ve begun to do as part of my program, different me is writing them and helping others write and rewrite theirs. 

There are certainly moments when I find myself pouring over data, losing myself in code, and spontaneously reading research papers. That’s a reassurance I’m holding onto tightly: that the research itself is more fun than banging my head against the math underlying it. But as to whether or not I’ll continue doing research after the program, it’s unlikely, if I had to guess. The academic life doesn’t suit me. But I’m ok with that. I'm still learning a lot. (And don’t worry Mom and Dad, I plan to finish graduate school!)

Am I just limiting my potential, am I not trying hard enough? Maybe, but I don’t think so. Life takes shape when we constrain ourselves, and the best constraint is knowing who you really are and what you enjoy most, and fearlessly pursuing that.

---

A commandment then: Confront your limits with grace. Try your best in what you do, but don’t beat yourself up for not being as good as others – there will always be someone better than you. Enjoy the opportunity to learn as much as you can instead. Be you. And don’t define yourself solely by your work.

>_“...The Jews also talk about how God judges you for your gifts. Rabbi Zusya once said that when he died, he wasn’t worried that God would ask him “Why weren’t you Moses?” or “Why weren’t you Solomon?” But he did worry that God might ask ‘Why weren’t you Rabbi Zusya?’_

>_And this is part of why it’s important for me to believe in innate ability, and especially differences in innate ability. If everything comes down to hard work and a positive attitude, then God has every right to ask me ‘Why weren’t you Srinivasa Ramanujan?’ or ‘Why weren’t you Elon Musk?’_
