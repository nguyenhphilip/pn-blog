This was a rough week for me. I spent over 25 hours on a single assignment for one of my classes, Data Science II. Most of the problems included deriving probability distributions and some of their properties, which meant that I had to dust the cobwebs off of the many mathematical tools necessary to do so. And boy were they dusty.

I struggled, and I wasn’t sure how to gauge whether my struggles simply indicated a lack of mathematical fluency, which could be remedied through practice and a firmer grasp of the fundamentals, or if I just wasn’t “getting” it at some deeper intuitive level. This of course led me to wonder if I would _ever_ get it, to the degree that my professor or any other data science practitioner in the ivory tower or industry does. 

I was talking with my classmate Julia about this. Neither of us have academic backgrounds in math (she in linguistics, I in psychology), so we feel somewhat lost when it comes to the technical details. We lean on analogy and intuition more than anything, but sometimes it doesn’t feel like it’s enough. Sometimes one really does need to understand something deeply in order to grasp it intuitively. I don’t think anyone doubts that, but how hard should one try to get to this point? And what should one do if that point is never reached? Should we accept that we will never be as good as some of these other folks, or will stubbornness and persistence be our savior? Is it enough to be good enough? I think it is to Julia. She, perhaps rightly so, believes that there are probably at least a few organizations or groups of people in the world who would be happy to receive help from any average data scientist – not everyone needs a theory-stoned academic to solve their problems. They just want their problems solved.

So maybe what matters is being useful. Wherever we fall on the grand distribution of things, we can always serve those around us. That’s reassuring. But there are an infinite number of ways to be useful! And some of those ways are better suited for us than others, depending on things like personality, interests, and values. These are not moot considerations to ignore when reflecting on what is worth doing with your time. Anything worth doing in the long run involves expected challenges, but when it deprecates to a form of chronic struggle, to the point where you’re sleepwalking through life, you have to ask yourself why you’re pursuing that thing in the first place, and if you truly enjoy it. 

Is enjoyment really that important in a career? If The Why is the mission, then enjoyment is what defines our experience of it. It’s usually implied that, given we had the choice, we do enjoy what we work on, at least partially. But what we think we enjoy and even what we do enjoy can get distorted by the allure of prestige. Paired with ambition and you have yourself a deadly cocktail. It matters to see through this illusion, not just because [to do something well you have to enjoy it](http://www.paulgraham.com/love.html), but also because your work defines so much of your life, and hence the quality of it. This doesn’t mean that you’re supposed to be head-over-heels at every waking hour when working, because there are just some things you have to persist through. And some days just suck, for no reason. But would you be doing what you're doing if you were given the freedom and security to do whatever you wanted to do? If you could get at The Why in some other, more enjoyable way that caters to you as a person, why aren’t you doing that instead?

The other day I watched a video titled [“Why I’m Not a Scientist" by Youtuber 2Veritasium](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZtmX1nPmoA&list=LL&index=30). In it he shares his story about why he pursued something more artistic rather than academic. In addition to his background in biology, chemistry, and physics, he had been interested in many other things like music, acting, and making videos with his friends. The latter suited his personality more, and he also realized that he liked the idea of being a successful scientist more than the actual process of doing science. That realization was what led him to pursue a Ph.D. in Physics Education rather than one in Physics. Now he’s a Youtuber.

I mention the video not because I want to dissuade people from science, but because I think it's important to know who you are, and not to run from that. I look over at my bookshelf and see that it’s full of poetry and short story collections, novels, and psychology books: The Body Keeps the Score. The Art of Seeing Things. How to Change Your Mind. Transcend. In the Realm of Hungry Ghosts. The Fear of Doing Nothing. The Denial of Death. Already Free. These books feel self-defining, like old friends I could chat with all day. There’s some technical science and math stuff sitting on the shelves too, but maybe that’s because I like knowing about the world more than being the guy who generates its knowledge, scientifically speaking. And thinking about the sorts of conversations I have with my closest friends, words like healer, writer, artist, psychologist are thrown at me in both nonchalant and serious tones. Even my Dad has joined that parade a few times. I’ve helped many of them with personal issues and naturally gravitate toward a helper role in these conversations. Others find it exhausting to listen to your friends all day, but for me it feels invigorating. Rather than study stories, which is what I’ve begun to do as part of my program, this other potential version of me is writing them and helping others write and rewrite theirs. 

There are certainly moments when I lose myself in research projects and spontaneously reading of academic papers. That’s somewhat reassuring because it means that I probably do enjoy some of these things, which justifies the math struggles. But as to whether or not I’ll continue doing research after the program, it’s unlikely, if I had to guess. Not for lack of trying, because some people like the PI of my study and others think I can genuinely do it - I am doing it! - but because I feel a fundamental disconnect between how I'm spending my time and what my strengths are. That doesn't mean I think I'm wasting my time - I just don't see myself sitting day in and out doing research. It doesn't make my heart sing the way it does for some of my amazing peers.

Am I just being lazy? Am I limiting my own potential with this kind of thinking? Maybe, but I don’t think so. Life takes shape when we constrain ourselves, and the best constraint is knowing who you really are and what you enjoy most. Accepting this, perhaps paradoxically, unlocks so much more. You start make things work _for_ you rather than against you. You stop conforming to fit into boxes not meant for you anyways, while creating more space for others. In the process you're seen as a fearless trailblazer, an innovator, a creative independent, when all you're really doing is [being yourself.](https://www.brainpickings.org/2017/09/25/e-e-cummings-advice/)

Some instructions for when things get hard: _Confront your limits with grace. Try your best in what you do, but don’t beat yourself up for not being as good as others – there will always be someone better than you. Enjoy the opportunity to learn instead. Be you. Make it work for you. And don’t define yourself solely by your work._

_“...The Jews also talk about how God judges you for your gifts. Rabbi Zusya once said that when he died, he wasn’t worried that God would ask him “Why weren’t you Moses?” or “Why weren’t you Solomon?” But he did worry that God might ask ‘Why weren’t you Rabbi Zusya?’_

_And this is part of why it’s important for me to believe in innate ability, and especially differences in innate ability. If everything comes down to hard work and a positive attitude, then God has every right to ask me ‘Why weren’t you Srinivasa Ramanujan?’ or ‘Why weren’t you Elon Musk?’_

_If everyone is legitimately a different person with a different brain and different talents and abilities, then all God gets to ask me is whether or not I was [Scott Alexander.](https://slatestarcodex.com/2015/01/31/the-parable-of-the-talents/)_

_This seems like a gratifyingly low bar.”_
