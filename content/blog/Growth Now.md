I am often thinking about the next thing and the big Future future, but I finally feel like I’ve come to accept that this is now my life - grad school, learning, simple living. It's the first time I feel free without needing to run or be in constant motion. 

Some days I miss it, the familiar yearnings for elsewheres and foreign roads. They are still there if I dig deep enough, though in a different, more mature form. Rather than lead me to new vistas, they've begun to guide me toward richer experiences in what has become the daily. Whether it is with old friends and half-kindled relationships, partially learned songs and shelved books collecting dust, or goals and ambitions that would have previously been uncommitted from when they inevitably grew difficult to pursue, the roots I've developed are being embodied. Where the tree branches off to isn't as important anymore as embracing the seasonality of it all, wherever it may lead me. 

>I’m writing less but living more, saying yes and opening doors.
>
>I’m surfing the waves of singular moments and riding the rhythms of existence, wherever they decide to take me, without resistance. 
>
>Chasing sunrises and sunfalls, with a loaf of bread in my pack. Listening to that far inward call without looking back.

It’s a sweet form of surrender. So often we're fighting against ourselves while resolving the competing desires that fuel our lives. I had to decide what was most important to me and let go of everything else. It's simple but not always easy. But the alternative is to live a fractured life.

*Ici et Maintenant*

{{< poem_open >}}
* Some days are meant just to be
* Fully lived, existing, no trace of memories.
* Is it enough? We’ll never know;
* We only get one viewing of this lifetime show.
* The tickets expire on some forlorn date
* Let’s take this moment to defy our fate.
* Up over the mountains and into the sky
* Today’s another day to be alive.
* No I don’t have the answers to your heart’s perfect questions.
* But I can offer a hand, this, and my standing affection.
