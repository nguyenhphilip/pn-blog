Between every relationship we ever had, have, and will have, there exists a unique configuration of constellations that defines its being. For some it radiates and burns with the intensity of a sun. Let it grow and we risk hurting ourselves, hurting others, discovering truths that we aren't yet ready to witness; yet left unkindled and we might just miss the very thing that gives life its color. Most of us tread cautiously. We avoid the fluttering flames who spire skyward above the sparks, the individuals who dazzles us with their flare and brazen capacity for vulnerability, the souls we imagine might be strong enough to redefine the ephemeral notes that mark who we are. Even just a hint of their beauty is enough for a lifetime. Yet once graced with their presence, we will never be the same.
