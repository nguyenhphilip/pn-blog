Each and every day I wake and walk with the sun.<br>
It starts low, climbing over hillsides, rising slowly.<br>
At last it finds its place in the sky<br>
and begins to color the Meseta.

Front and center a shadow grows.<br>
It looks at me with indifference â€“ a mirror of my darker side.<br>
Fear, insecurity, doubt,<br>
The manifestation of my inner demons.

Each and every day, I wake and walk and confront them.<br>
If I fight and struggle, I hurt and suffer.<br>
If I push them away, I push myself away.<br>
I cannot hide, I cannot run,<br>
I can only bear witness.

Salvation lies within absence. <br>
But do I do it? Do I dare eclipse the sun?<br>
To turn from the shadows is to turn from truth.<br>
I would be swallowed whole.

My shadow is here,<br>
my shadow is me.<br>
So long as I walk the Way,<br>
it will keep me company.

I can't be scared<br>
I mustn't be afraid.<br>
I must continue on and on and on,<br>
moving toward the falling sun.

Each and every day, I wake and walk towards Santiago.<br>
The closer I get, the lighter I feel.<br>
The sun hangs low, peering over hillsides, descending slowly.<br>
Color fades from the Meseta, and my shadow is behind me.

Westward lies Santiago, and I look.<br>
The sun has set, the dark has settled.<br>
A fire begins to grow deep inside.<br>
It lights the valley and shows me the Way.<br>
I wake and walk toward the Light,<br>
closer and closer to Santiago.
