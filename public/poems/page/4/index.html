    <p> The rainbow is our dream our sky sketched from creation, our soul canvas colored by dancing constellations. A place open to all (if you&rsquo;re not afraid of heights) A home for two who craft dreams by candlelight.   <span> <a href="/poems/our-dream/">Read more...</a></span>

    <p> Pens and paintbrushes scattered on the bathroom floor. Half-finished poems and crooked photos line the chipping walls. In the dark corners our two desks rest– the candles are beyond extinguished– our eyesight isn&rsquo;t the best. Loved ones tell us they&rsquo;re concerned they say we need something different But we can still see we already have All that we dream of.   <span> <a href="/poems/our-room/">Read more...</a></span>

    <p>She sits in her lab with a handful of instruments and a head full of clues. Surrounding her are guesses, and things She already knew. If only She could see it, if only She could understand how it all fits together in the grand master plan. The past always resolves the future, or so she&rsquo;s told, in the present of her time, but still, She feels, There is so much left to find and so little that is known.<span> <a href="/poems/knowledge/">Read more...</a></span>

    <p>What rooms of the soul have we left unchecked Forgotten and locked away With the key nowhere to be found? Don&rsquo;t worry. The door is still open. Climb the creaking stairs Open the dust-covered drawers and look in Run your fingers along the wooden shelves, now draped in darkness, somewhere in the attic of your mind. Once there you may rediscover the very thing You have been searching for Your entire life.<span> <a href="/poems/dwell/">Read more...</a></span>

    <p>Before there was you Before there was you and your billowing laugh Your callused hands and crooked smile, waiting for me at the end of the night like temptation drunk on wine Before there was the oak that introduced us Before there were the stars that we claimed as ours Before love and wonder became forces we would never tame Before time had entered the fray Before there was the story of everything, waiting to unfold, Nothing was the only thing And that was enough for a universe.<span> <a href="/poems/exhalation/">Read more...</a></span>
