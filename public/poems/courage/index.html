                <p>You knew it wouldn’t work. You knew it didn’t feel right. You knew not to actively pursue it. But you did it anyways.</p>
<p>You wanted to be sure, you tell yourself. You wanted the truth and nothing but the truth. And the only way for you to know it was real, the only way for you to know that it was worth holding onto, just so you could let it go, was to feel the edges for yourself.</p>
<p>The pain reminds you that you’re alive. That letting go doesn’t come easily. That loneliness and turmoil will always accompany you on the long road from here to there. In that regard you are never truly alone.</p>
<p>Unmet expectations. Old beliefs. Objects of the past with the potential to destroy all futures.</p>
<p>There’s no easy way to leave the house behind. Fear and emptiness have settled in. They have penetrated your soul like a flood searching for rest within a vacant valley, carving and eroding all that it meets. The storm, you know it so well.</p>
<p>Coming and going like waves, it’s only a matter of time until they’re gone. Emptiness and solitude take their place, and the door swings open.</p>
<p>The clouds make their retreat. The sun slowly advances. Light pours through the windows, and color fills the room. Guests have arrived.</p>
<p>You stare at them with curious eyes. You can’t help but wonder.</p>
<p>What if?</p>
<p>Optimism abundant. Dreams reimagined. Possibility percolating at the forefront of your being.</p>
