                <p>I spent most of my childhood immersed in the digital landscape of video games. Which meant that I didn’t spend much time thinking about who I wanted to be or what I wanted to do when I grew up. I was a gamer.</p>
<p>In my last year of high school, the enthusiasm of a cheery psychology teacher lead me to develop an interest in the inner landscapes of the human mind. If I learned how the mind worked, I thought, then I would learn what it was that I actually wanted to do when I grew up.</p>
<p>Of course, learning about the mind as a scientific subject didn&rsquo;t provide any answers to my existential questions about self and identity. If anything, it made things worse. Having no clear path or compass to guide me, I did what any lost person would do and threw myself further into the only arena I felt at home: League of Legends. I became one of the top 0.1% of players in the game, though the glory was temporary and short-lived. While I felt like a winner on Summoner’s Rift, life was a game I had yet to dare approach. It was a game I was ultimately losing in.</p>
<p>I quit during the summer of my 4th year of college and enrolled in a 6-week study that taught me how to meditate, among other things. Meditation changed the way I perceived myself and the world. It helped me come to the fact that I wasn’t fully subject to the natural whims of my environment and emotions. I could choose what part of my experience to attend to, which was key in steering myself away from the allure of my pixelated past, and into a more meaningful future. For the rest of the year I threw myself into popular psychology books like <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/mihaly_csikszentmihalyi_on_flow">Flow</a> and <a href="http://www.normandoidge.com/?page_id=1259">The Brain That Changes Itself</a>. I began searching for something akin to happiness and the meaning of life.</p>
<p>After graduating from college I worked at an intensive outpatient center focused on treating drug addiction and mental health problems where I mainly I dealt with the insurance side of things. I also interacted with and listened to the stories of our patients on a daily basis. They taught me that the road to recovery was arduous and long, but never out of reach. They were great teachers, as were the lovely therapists on my team. Empathy, mindfulness, and compassion were essential.</p>
<p>Despite outward appearances of success, I was constantly burdened by the weight of worry. I had spent most of my life learning how to excel in school and video games, a place where the expectations were predefined, the objectives clear. This was no longer the case, and I was suffering the consequences: aimlessness, despondence, a lack of meaning. Eventually I left and moved back in with my parents and began a six month soul-search.</p>
<p>It was tough. I spent a lot of days not doing much of anything. I tried teaching myself how to program, but the lack of structure and a timeline made the task daunting. Teaching English in Spain was another option I considered, but I had run out of patience and wasn&rsquo;t ready to deal with the logistics of a Spanish escapade.</p>
<p>I ended up taking a year-long position as an AmeriCorps member with the educational nonprofit City Year in Manchester, New Hampshire where I worked as a student mentor in a 4th and 5th grade Title I classroom. Many of the students were performaing several grade levels below state standards, and I was supposed to change that. As the year progressed, I grew more curious about the circumstances surrounding my students. Most of them lived in a state of constant stress and disarray, factors that surely degraded their academic performance and any prospect of a better future. After all, how could they focus on learning how to read and write when their words had little impact in their circumstances outside of school?</p>
<p>Yet school was all they had. It was the safe-haven in which they could play and be with friends, express themselves and their grand ideas, experiment and be full-blooded kids. I couldn’t change much about their circumstances, but for 6 hours a day, they at least had each other and me. I brought in fresh fruit for them; I helped them build and program robots; I taught them how to meditate. And they taught me how to love.</p>
<p>Two weeks before City Year ended, I was accepted into a graduate program for Educational Leadership and Policy Studies at Boston University, but both the price tag and the career prospects made me reconsider. Ultimately it didn’t feel like a good fit for me, so I decided not to take the offer. With no clear plan in sight and an apartment lease coming to its end, I took a last minute job as a camp counselor in Maine.</p>
<p>In many ways Gem, the camp director, was right when he said, “This will be the hardest job you will ever love!” At all hours of the clock, I was responsible for the joy and well-being of my assigned campers, as well as that of others. Every free thought and action was supposed to be dedicated toward creating a $14,000 summer camp extravaganza. Solitude came only in stolen moments, something I desperately craved at the end of the day. Thankfully, I was able to find the necessary time and space to apply for a few post-camp jobs, though I heard back from only one company and was later rejected by them.</p>
<p>This lead me to buy a one-way ticket to Europe to walk the <a href="/tags/camino-de-santiago/">Camino de Santiago</a>, a month-long pilgrimage in Northern Spain. I had promised myself when I was in New Hampshire that I’d walk it at some later point in my life, but the circumstances could be no more perfect. With no job secured and a lack of formal obligations, I was free to trot across foreign lands, to search for new direction.</p>
<p>The Camino is a magical place. It challenged me to grow and feel emotions I had only glimpsed before - awe, gratitude, joy, deep connection with others and the earth, love beyond bounds. In part this was due to a girl I met. We met on the second day of my journey. She was a medical student from Belgium, walking the Camino in search of clarity too. We exchanged stories and taught each other about life over the next 14 days. Then she was gone. She had to go home to resume her medical studies. I continued onward.</p>
<p>I made more friends along the way, but mostly I was accompanied only by the echoes of solitary footsteps and the beautiful vistas of the Meseta and Galacia. I often thought about what life would be like once I was back in the States. Career-wise I still wasn’t sure what I wanted to do. I knew I enjoyed teaching, storytelling, and showing people the beauty of the world. I also remembered how fascinated I was by psychology and the brain before I was lobbed into the post-college world.</p>
<p>Upon arriving in Santiago de Compostela, the official end destination of the Camino, my sense of self slipped away. I felt a profound sense of openness and connection, a lightness that radiated throughout my entire being. For what may have been the first time in my life, it didn’t matter who I was, what I was doing, or how the future would unfold. I felt free <a href="/post/2017/12/28/16-santiago/">just to be.</a></p>
<p>I stayed a few extra days in the city before finishing the last leg of my journey. I said my goodbyes to the many walkers and friends I had made at the start of my Camino, and then I was off to Belgium. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6l7ULd_sGY">I had to go see about a girl.</a></p>
<p>Coming home was difficult. Nothing had changed, yet I felt completely different, displaced. It was hard for family and friends to relate. My mind and body yearned for foreign roads, and anywhere but there was colorless.</p>
<p>I mulled around for weeks, then decided to write about the experience. It gave me a sense of purpose, a reason to wake up and move forward. After finishing the story, I felt ready to engage with life again. I wasn&rsquo;t sure if I wanted to continue adventuring overseas or not, but my prospects for landing a research-related job seemed slim, so I prepared myself to teach English abroad while applying to work in several research labs. Later I interviewed with a primary school in Hungary and was offered a position. It was settled. I would move to Budapest and figure things out from there.</p>
<p>Except some days later, I received a request to interview with a group of researchers in Vermont. My mind was already set on Hungary, but I decided to interview anyways. As I learned more about the team and the research, I realized how awesome the project was, and how much I liked the people working on it. The interview ended on a good note, though I didn’t expect to be offered the position. But there it was sitting in my inbox one week later.</p>
<p>It was a tough decision to make: to continue exploring the world, or to hunker down and build a &ldquo;career&rdquo;. Each day my mind settled on something different. One morning I’d feel ecstatic about the prospect of learning a new language, of living and teaching in a foreign country. The next my excitement swayed toward more practical ambitions on the homefront. I eventually settled on Vermont, reasoning that 1) it would still be a new adventure in many ways, 2) if I was truly searching for a challenge, then I would choose to grow some roots, and 3) if I didn’t like it, I could always go back to teaching abroad.</p>
<p>The decision was made. I packed my life into three bags, just as I had for New Hampshire a year prior, and moved to Vermont.</p>
<p>Living in Vermont has turned out to be much lovelier than anticipated. There are seasons, for one, unlike in California, which are a welcome reminder of the everchanging, cyclical nature of life. Until life&rsquo;s currents takes me elsewhere, I am happy to call the green mountain state my home.</p>
